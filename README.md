## Basically a random project using Gemini api to analyze pictures of treadmill data tha is on the display and OCR the data from it. Then it puts that data in a table and also in a chart so you can "track your run stats" a little better.

This was a little "vibe-coded", because I was just trying to see what was possible to do and trying to explore creativity a little bit.
